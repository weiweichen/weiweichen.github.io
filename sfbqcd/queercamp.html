  <h1 class="display-10">Our Camp</h1>
  <a href="www.queercontradance.org">San Francisco Bay Queer Contra Dance's </a>
  twelfth annual camp welcomes dancers of all identities and experience.
  We use the calling terms larks and robins, prioritize consent, and have gender-free facilities so that everyone can be included.
  New dancers will find that contra is an exuberant, social, and easy-to-learn American barn dance with roots in English folk dance.
  For experienced dancers, dancing as part of a community that prioritizes inclusion and everyone's enjoyment
  is one of the most magical and exuberant opportunities contra provides.
  Take a weekend away with us to dance, relax, make friends, and enjoy the lovely California redwoods.

  See <a href="https://dashboard.intrinsicimpact.org/public/results/bb01e5925a5b50cbce6be17c"> what campers said </a> about Queer Contra Dance Camp 2019!  
  <br/>
  <br/>

  This year's (2023) theme is <strong>"Way Out West"</strong> and we encourage those who enjoy dressing up to bring something in theme for our Saturday night dance.

  The cost of camp includes dormitories to stay in,
  three meals on Saturday and breakfast and lunch on Sunday,
  and a delicious spread of snacks throughout the weekend.
  Meals are served buffet-style with vegetarian and vegan options.
  Refrigerator space is available for those on special diets.

  Accommodations are shared rooms ranging from 4-10 people or campground space for
  those who would prefer to bring a tent to sleep in.
  Rooms are pre-assigned, and campers have the chance to express housing preferences and needs as part of registration.
  Campers need to bring their own towels, pillows, and sleeping bags or sheets and blankets.
  Local dancers are asked to bring extra bedding and towels for campers flying in from out of state.

  <h1 class="display-10">Registration</h1>
  The cost of running camp is about $360 per person, but we have a sliding scale starting at $120 to make the weekend accessible to as many people as possible.
  Transparency about our costs and our sliding scale recommendations are on the second page of our
  <a href="https://forms.gle/d4d9EkDhFjR6stMK6">registration form</a>.
  If you need to cancel your registration, we will fully refund cancellations through January 31 or for health reasons.
  After February 1, other refunds (minus a $50 fee) are not guaranteed but may be available if your vacant spot is filled.
  If paying the full cost when registering is stressful, you can register today and pay later.

  <h1 class="display-10">Health Safety Precautions</h1>
We know that everyone is in different places as to their own feelings around COVID-19 and health safety. As a group event in 2023 we want to put some precautions in place to help to lessen the chance of illness for our talent and campers and allow the most people possible to attend.

<br/>
<br/>
Currently we expect everyone to test before camp within 72 hours of arriving and bring a picture of the test to camp.
We will require everyone to be vaccinated with at least three shots and strongly encourage getting the September 2022 bi-valent booster that adds extra Omicron protection. Everyone will also need to mask while dancing or in a room with a dance or workshop, unless actively drinking water, calling dances, or playing music. Doors and windows in the main dance hall will be left open for maximum ventilation during the day and until they need to be closed for sound reasons in the evening. Masking will be optional for the rest of camp activities. Our venue has outdoor dining, tent camping, and outdoor social spaces available for those who would like to not be unmasked indoors with other people. We recognize that the situation continues to evolve and we will review our policies as camp approaches. If they happen, we will announce any changes to attendees in advance of camp

  <h1 class="display-10">Transportation</h1>
Queer Contra Camp is 79 miles or a 2 hour drive south of San Francisco. Monte Toyon is only accessible by private vehicle, with limited parking on-site. If you can offer a ride or need a ride to/from camp, please let us know on the registration form. We are generally able to get everyone a ride from the Bay Area who needs one. If you are flying in, we recommend arriving at Oakland or San Jose airports by 5:00 pm on Friday, April 7. While we will have snacks Friday night, we encourage everyone coming to eat before they arrive at camp.
Campers flying into San Francisco may need to take public transit to meet their carpool and we don’t expect to have rides available for campers arriving in the evening.
